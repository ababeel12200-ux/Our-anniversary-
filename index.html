  <h1>Happy Anniversary Shaimuuu ❤️</h1>

  <p>
     Shaimuuu, even though miles separate us, 
    my heart feels your presence every single day. 
    From the moment we wake up to the quiet nights when I think of you, 
    every memory of us brings a smile to my face. Your laughter is my favorite melody,
    and your love is my safest place.

    There have been times when we argued or misunderstood each other, 
    but even through those moments, we always found a way to talk, 
    forgive, and grow stronger together. Every fight only reminds me how 
    much I value you and how important it is to work through everything with love and patience.

    1.6 years of love, trust, and togetherness have flown by so fast, 
    yet I feel like this is only the beginning of our forever. 
    No matter the distance or the challenges we face, I know we’ll always stay by each other’s side, 
    supporting and caring for one another through it all.

    Thank you for being my constant support, my joy, and my heart. 
    Through laughs, tears, fights, and happy moments, 
    you are my everything — my happiness, my comfort, and my love. 
    I cherish every memory we’ve created and look forward to a lifetime of staying together ❤️
  </p>
